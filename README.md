This repository contains a web-based chatbot (React + Vite frontend) and a Flask backend that serves an AI-based fake news detector.

Contents:
- backend/: Flask API, training script, utils, model placeholders
- frontend/: React + Vite chatbot UI
- docker/: Dockerfiles and docker-compose
- deployment-guides/: step-by-step deploy guides for Render, Vercel, and Heroku
